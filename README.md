## 🛠️ Tech & Tools

- **React.js**: Dynamic frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Used for sleek and modern UI components.

## 🚀 Overview

Happy Commerce is an eCommerce platform prototype designed to showcase product listings and a functional cart system. The app fetches product data from a public API and allows users to add items to their cart. The cart persists using **local storage**, ensuring the items remain saved between page reloads.

## 🎯 Features

- **Product Listing**: Fetches and displays products from [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/).
- **Add to Cart**: Seamless addition of products to the shopping cart, with data stored in the browser's local storage.
- **Persistent Cart**: Even after refreshing the page, your cart remains intact using the `useEffect` hook to retrieve items from local storage.
- **Deployed with Vercel**: Easy and fast deployment, live on [Vercel](https://happy-commerce-alpha.vercel.app/).
